/// Momentum: a consecutive-hit damage ramp — each landed hit multiplies the equipped ATTACK's damage by a per-tier
/// factor (stacking, capped by <see cref="MaxStacks"/>), and the ramp RESETS when a full swing/combo recovers to
/// neutral having connected nothing. Self-contained: it reads the existing <see cref="OnHitDealt"/> and the
/// <see cref="OnAnimEnd"/> hook (fired only when a swing/combo ends without chaining), so no Player API is needed.
///
/// <para>Reset semantics use per-swing state rather than the raw per-hitbox OnMiss (a multi-hit attack fires one box
/// per hit-frame): <see cref="_hitThisSwing"/> is set by any OnHitDealt and cleared at each OnAnimEnd; a swing that
/// ends with it still false is a genuine whiff → the ramp drops to 1.0. Consecutive connecting swings keep the ramp.</para>
///
/// <para>The doc gives only the per-hit factor; <see cref="MaxStacks"/> is a placeholder cap so Epic (×2/hit) can't
/// compound unbounded — tune during playtest. Built by <see cref="BuffCatalog"/>.</para>
