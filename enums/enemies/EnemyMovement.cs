{
    Ground,      // walks toward the player to chase (the default cohort: Kebus, Baghel, Mazab, Matat, Tarri, Breski)
    Flying,      // airborne, ignores gravity/platforms (Ein — the DiverEnemy)
    Stationary,  // holds position, never moves (Nasen — the SleeperEnemy: dormant until triggered, then hits in place)
}
// NOTE: no "Charger" — a lunging enemy isn't a movement type; the lunge lives in the ATTACK (a StrikeType.Lunge /
// Kamikaze attack carries a `Lunge` impulse, like Khalid's Zahluq), so no run/charge animation is needed.
