"""Generate SpriteFrames (.tres) resources from the character sprite sheets.

The source sheets are single-row uniform grids, but frame size varies per
animation (32x32 idle vs 143x48 attack) and some sheets carry a constant
horizontal padding bias. Slicing them as-is makes the character jump around
when the animation changes.

This script normalises every frame onto one shared canvas:
  - vertically   : frame bottom == canvas bottom (the sheets are foot-anchored)
  - horizontally : frame 0 of every animation is the neutral pre-action pose
                   (its bounding box matches idle frame 0 exactly), so we anchor
                   on that. Anchoring on the mean instead would let a dash's
                   fire trail or an attack's swing arc drag the body off-centre.
                   Later frames keep their own offsets, so lunges still lunge.

Normalisation is expressed with AtlasTexture.margin, so no images are rewritten
and no extra VRAM is used -- the atlases still point at the original PNGs.

Re-run after adding a character or re-exporting a sheet:

#                (a channel/rage), so the lead-in only plays once. Works with loop on or off.
